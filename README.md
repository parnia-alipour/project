## Machine Learning
___
 In this project, we work with various machine learning algorithms and learn how to build an artificial intelligence model. The project includes 10 diverse algorithms applied to different datasets, featuring methods such as :

1. `k-nearest neighbors`
2. `logistic regression`
3. `Svm`

 and more ...

 This project also includes two clustering algorithms that help us better understand and learn the other machine learning models.

##  All the projects are written in both Persian and English.

Please take a look at Music.ipynb first.👩🏻‍💻🙏🏻
